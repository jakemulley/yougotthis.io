        <dt>How does your talk submission process work?</dt>
        <dd>Submit before the end of September 30 2020. We will anonymize submissions of names, pronouns, and any other identifying features.

        <dd>Our inclusion programme provides workshop tickets for those in under-represented groups in tech. This includes, but isn't limited to: LGBTQIA+ people, people of colour, women, non-binary people, and those with disabilities. Applications will be open November 1 to November 15, will be a short 5 minute form, and prioritizes our understanding of what you will hope to get out of the event over the need to disclose any sensitive information.</dd>
