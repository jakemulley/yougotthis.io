The You Got This community is filled with amazing, clever and creative people, and we're excited for you to join us. Our goal is to create spaces where people can gather and discuss important themes and feelings that many of us will experience during our technical career.

## Being a Good Community Member

Yes, there are things we don’t want you to do in our community — and we’ll get to those. But first we’d like to talk about things we do want folks to do. These are ways you can be a positive member of the You Got This community.

Please begin by thinking carefully about and agreeing with the following statements:

- I will be welcoming to everyone at the table, and patient with newcomers
- I will treat everyone with respect, because they deserve it
- I will be mindful of the needs and boundaries of others

Here are a few other key things you can do to make the community great:

### Be Humble
People come from all different places, and it’s best not to make assumptions about what they think or feel. Approach others with curiosity. We all have a lot to learn from each other.

### Be Helpful When Asked
If someone asks for help, consider jumping in to point them in the right direction.

### Encourage Others
There’s no one path to have a career in technology. Instead of shooting down other people’s ideas, try to engage them in ways that create opportunities for learning and fun.

## Code of Conduct

We ask everyone who participates in our community upholds their ideals. By vowing to follow these guidelines, you will help create a welcoming and friendly community based on respect and trust.

We are committed to creating a harassment-free community. These rules will be strictly enforced in any and all of our official spaces, like our Discord server and physical events, and everyone who participates in these spaces is required to agree to this community code. We have zero-tolerance for harassment, and anybody who engages in the following behaviors may be banned without warning. We also ask and expect community members to observe these rules anywhere the community is meeting (for example, online chats in unofficial platforms or event after-parties).

### Be Respectful
Don’t make offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, immigration status, religion, or other identity markers.

Additionally, don’t insult or demean others. This includes making unwelcome comments about a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including things related to diet, health, parenting, drugs, or employment. It’s not okay to insult or demean others if it’s “just a joke.”

### Be Welcoming and Open
Don’t engage in gatekeeping behaviors, like questioning the intelligence or knowledge of others as a way to prove their credentials. And don’t exclude people for prejudicial reasons.

### Respect Privacy
Do not publish private communications without consent. Additionally, never “out” private aspects of a person’s personal identity without consent, except as necessary to protect them from intentional abuse.

### Respect Personal Identity
Use people’s preferred pronouns. Do not deliberately misgender others or use “dead” or rejected names. Additionally, we ask that you approach matters of personal identity with joy: please be proactive in asking how others prefer to be identified if you are unsure, and accept their identity with enthusiasm.

### Respect Personal Boundaries
Do not introduce gratuitous or off-topic sexual images, languages, or behavior in spaces where they are not appropriate. Never make physical contact or simulated physical contact without consent or after a request to stop. Additionally, do not continue to message others about anything if they ask you to stop or leave them alone.

### Be a Good Neighbor
Do not make threats of violence, intimidate others, incite violence or intimidation against others, incite self-harm, stalk, follow, or otherwise harass others.

## Rules for online spaces
For You Got This' official online spaces, like our community Discord channel, we have some additional rules. Any of the following behaviors can result in a ban without warning.

### Don't Spam
Don't spam. We'll ban you.

### Keep It Legal
If it’s illegal, it’s not allowed on our websites or in our online spaces. Please don’t share links to pirated material or other nefarious things.

### No Trolling
Please be earnest. Don’t use excessive sarcasm to annoy or undermine other people. And don’t bait them with bad faith comments or abuse.

### Pornography and Other NSFW Stuff
Please don’t post it or link to it. We’re not against it, but it doesn’t belong in our online spaces.

### Foul and Graphic Language
Please do not use excessive curse words. Additionally, do not use graphic sexual or violent language — again, think of our spaces as places for people of all ages.

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of the You Got This community, or if you observe someone else being harassed, please report the behaviour using our [Code of Conduct Report Form](/report).
